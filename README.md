### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

#### I'm Sajad, an old time geek! I changed my whole life to pursue my love for Programming. I Try to write code for humans, machines eventually will understand it anyway! I love creating web applications and I believe in minimalism in life and code. Less is better...
- ğŸ”­ I use DotNet/C# and Python/Django for developing things right now
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning. From this day to my last day!

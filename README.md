### Hi there 👋

My name is Sajad, an old-time geek! I love programming and creating web applications. I Try to write code for humans, machines eventually will understand it anyway! I believe in minimalism in life and code, Less is better...

I'm interested in the whole web application development life cycle; from small apps with a handful of users to hundreds of microservices with millions of users. Engineering, designing, and implementing them just excites me.

- 🌱 I’m always learning. From this day to my last day!

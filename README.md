### Hi there 👋

Hi there, I'm Sajad, an old-school geek at heart!  Programming and building web applications are my jam.  I write code with humans in mind, figuring the machines will catch up eventually.   Minimalism is my motto, in life and code – less is definitely more!

The entire web development life cycle fascinates me, from tiny apps with a handful of users to massive microservices serving millions.  Engineering, designing, and bringing them to life – that's what gets me excited!

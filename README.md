### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Sajad, an old-school geek at heart!  Programming and building web applications is my jam.  I write code with people in mind, thinking that machines will eventually catch up.   Minimalism is my motto, in life and in code - less is definitely more!

The entire web development lifecycle fascinates me, from tiny apps with a handful of users to massive microservices serving millions.  Developing, designing, and bringing them to life - that's what excites me!

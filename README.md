### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

#### My name is Sajad, an old-time geek! I love programming and creating web applications. I Try to write code for humans, machines eventually will understand it anyway! I believe in minimalism in life and code, Less is better...
- ğŸ”­ I use DotNet/C# and Golang for developing things right now
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning. From this day to my last day!
